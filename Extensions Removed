# Steps Taken to Protect Against Malicious Extensions:

1. Audit Installed Extensions:
  * Reviewed all installed extensions in Chrome and/or Firefox.
  * Checked for unknown, unused, or suspicious extensions.
2. Permission Review:
  * Examined permissions requested by each extension (especially those with access to "all websites").
3. Extension Source Verification:
  * Verified if extensions were from trusted developers or the official store.
4. Update Check:
  * Ensured all extensions were up-to-date, as updates can patch known vulnerabilities.
5. Removed unnecessary or high-risk extensions, especially those:
  * With poor ratings or reviews.
  * That were not open-source or clearly documented.
  * That had not been updated in a long time.
