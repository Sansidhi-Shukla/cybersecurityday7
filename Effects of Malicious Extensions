# Research: How Malicious Browser Extensions Can Harm Users
Malicious browser extensions can seriously compromise user privacy and security. Here's how they can be harmful:

‚ö†Ô∏è Ways Malicious Extensions Harm Users:
1. Data Theft:
  * Read sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and browsing history.
  * Capture keystrokes and clipboard content.
2. Session Hijacking:
  * Steal cookies or session tokens to impersonate users on websites.
3. Ad Injection & Redirection:
  * Modify web pages to show ads or redirect users to phishing or scam sites.
4. Cryptojacking:
  * Use the user‚Äôs system resources (CPU/GPU) to mine cryptocurrency without consent.
5. Surveillance & Tracking:
  * Monitor user activity across sites, building a profile for surveillance or advertising purposes.
6. Privilege Abuse:
  * Extensions with broad permissions (e.g., "Read and change all your data on websites") can manipulate websites, APIs, and user input.
7. Spreading Malware:
  * Some extensions download and execute malicious scripts or act as a delivery vehicle for malware.
8. Persistent Access:
  * Use background scripts or silent updates to remain active and evade removal.

üß† Notable Examples:
# DataSpii: Popular Chrome extensions leaked sensitive user data to third parties.
# Fake AdBlockers: Some ad-blocking extensions were found to inject their own ads or track users.
